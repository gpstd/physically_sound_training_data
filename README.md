# physically_sound_training_data
Code and data for generation of physically sound training data will be uploaded soon

### Raw data sets:

The raw data sets Random30, Random50, Random100, Similar10, Similar30 and Similar50 can already be downloaded from https://gpstd.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/Raw_datasets.zip



### RotationNet:

For our evaluation we used RotationNet. It can be downloaded via:  
https://github.com/kanezaki/rotationnet



### Physical images of 3D-printed objects:

The images of the physical objects used for evaluation can be downloaded via:

https://gpstd.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/Physical_images/Similar50.zip

For some objects, 3D printing problems have been encountered, so photos of these objects are not yet available. Currently the SLS printers cannot be used due to the Corona crisis. Therefore the missing objects will be printed and photographed as soon as this is possible again.

For Similar50 two objects are missing: Pot6, Pot7  
For Random30 two objects are missing: cupcakemakplunger_1cm, heptagonal_1_5_cm

Furthermore, due to the Corona crisis we did not have access to professional camera equipment, so the pictures of the smaller objects are very blurred. These will also be replaced as soon as possible.
